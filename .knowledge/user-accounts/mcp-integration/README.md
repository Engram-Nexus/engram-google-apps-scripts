# MCP Integration

## Overview
Model Context Protocol server architecture for scalable user account management, featuring Durable Objects for session persistence, service token authentication, and Zero Trust policy integration.

## MCP Architecture

### Durable Objects Session Management
Persistent, globally distributed session handling:
- Stateful session objects with automatic persistence
- Global edge distribution for low latency
- Automatic state restoration across connections
- Concurrent session management capabilities

### Service Token Authentication
Server-to-server authentication patterns:
- JWT-based service authentication
- Token scoping and validation
- Service identity verification
- API key management integration

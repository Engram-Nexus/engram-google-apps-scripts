# Authorization

## Overview
Granular role-based access control (RBAC) system with 60+ permission levels, domain scoping, and fail-closed security patterns for Cloudflare MCP environments.

## Authorization Architecture

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Hierarchical permission system with granular control:
- 60+ distinct role definitions
- Inheritance-based permission cascading
- Dynamic role assignment capabilities
- Multi-tenant organizational support

### Domain-Level Permissions
Scoped access control within organizational boundaries:
- Global, organization, team, and personal scopes
- Cross-domain permission validation
- Resource-specific access patterns
- Tenant isolation enforcement

## Security Framework

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Minimal required permissions by default

- Regular permission auditing

### Fail-Closed Defaults
- Default-deny access control
- Explicit authorization requirements
- Secure error handling
- Zero-trust permission model
